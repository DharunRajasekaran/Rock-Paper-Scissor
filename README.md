## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Inside the `main.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

From there you will need to figure out: 
* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player. 

How to Play

Choose Your Move: Type rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.
Computerâ€™s Move: The computer will randomly choose a move.
Result Displayed: The game will display who won the round and update the score.
Play Again or Quit: After each round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.
